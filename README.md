# ROP-Project
Traditional ML baselines for ROP classification using retinal fundus images. Includes HOG+SVM and Sobel+SVM pipelines for binary and multi-class setups. This repo is the first phase of a larger project focused on building deep learning models to automatically grade ROP stages from clinical retinal images.
